	Abstract = {Here, we represent protein structures as residue interacting networks, which are assumed to involve a permanent flow of information between amino acids. By removal of nodes from the protein network, we identify fold centrally conserved residues, which are crucial for sustaining the shortest pathways and thus play key roles in long-range interactions. Analysis of seven protein families (myoglobins, G-protein-coupled receptors, the trypsin class of serine proteases, hemoglobins, oligosaccharide phosphorylases, nuclear receptor ligand-binding domains and retroviral proteases) confirms that experimentally many of these residues are important for allosteric communication. The agreement between the centrally conserved residues, which are key in preserving short path lengths, and residues experimentally suggested to mediate signaling further illustrates that topology plays an important role in network communication. Protein folds have evolved under constraints imposed by function. To maintain function, protein structures need to be robust to mutational events. On the other hand, robustness is accompanied by an extreme sensitivity at some crucial sites. Thus, here we propose that centrally conserved residues, whose removal increases the characteristic path length in protein networks, may relate to the system fragility.},
	Annote = {The authors use the metaphor of network communications to analyze protein behavior. Specifically, proteins have allosteric binding sites that allow activating or inhibitory molecules to bind to the protein, changing the conformation of the protein. The authors find that a relatively small number of these binding sites are crucial to the behavior of the protein. These binding sites are nodes that play a central role in maintaining shortest communication paths in the network model of the protein. Their model is confirmed by existing experiment.},

	Abstract = {We use geometrical considerations to provide a different perspective on the fact that a few selected amino acids, the so-called "key residues," act as nucleation centers for protein folding. By constructing graphs corresponding to protein structures we show that they have the "small-world" feature of having a limited set of vertices with large connectivity. These vertices correspond to the key residues that play the role of "hubs" in the network of interactions that stabilize the structure of the transition state.

	Abstract = {{Traditionally, proteins have been viewed as a construct based on
   elements of secondary structure and their arrangement in
   three-dimensional space. In a departure from this perspective we show
   that protein structures can be modelled as network systems that exhibit
   small-world, single-scale, and to some degree, scale-free properties.
   The phenomenological network concept of degrees of separation is
   applied to three-dimensional protein structure networks and reveals how
   amino acid residues can be connected to each other within six degrees
   of separation. This work also illuminates the unique features of
   protein networks in comparison to other networks currently studied.
   Recognising that proteins are networks provides a means of
   rationalising the robustness in the overall three-dimensional fold of a
   protein against random mutations and suggests an alternative avenue to
   investigate the determinants of protein structure, function and
   folding. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

	Abstract = {Identifying key residues important for maintaining a protein structure is a non-trivial problem in Computational Biology. In this paper, we present results based on a graph model representing protein structures. This model considers the structure as residue-residue interactions in order to capture protein stability. We propose the application of approximate minimum vertex cover algorithms (MVC) as a novel approach for identifying the structurally important residues, which we shall refer to as key residues. We establish that MVC based algorithms captures the essence of protein structural stability by correlation analysis with ΔΔG, the change of protein free energies due to amino acid variations. We also benchmark our approach with popular approaches for analyzing large complex networks --- betweenness, and Eigenvector centrality. Our findings are such that they do not correlate well with ΔΔG. We give explanations from the free energy point of view, which shall benefit future development measures for protein structure stability.},

	Annote = {The authors use a greedy MVC algorithm to search for key protein residues. The graph is modeled as G(V,E) where V represents the set of residues and E represents the interactions between those residues. The goal of the algorithm is to find a core set of residues that are related to all interactions. 

The residues are weighted based on two things: the number of interactions and the type of the interaction. That is, if there are two interactions between two residues, they would each gain a weight of two.

The authors compare their method to two other popular methods for identifying key residues, betweeness centrality and eignenvector centrality. They find that the MVC is a better approach for identifying key residues.},

	Annote = {Grandoni et al. provide a logarithmic time algorithm for computing the weighted vertex cover in a distributed manner. Their approach is to expand each vertex in the graph into $W$ vertexes, where $W$ is the weight of the vertex. These expanded vertexes are used to create a meta-graph, with the expanded vertexes of each edge connected to each other. A maximal matching is calculated on this meta-graph. If all of the expanded vertexes of an original vertex have an edge in the meta-graph matching, the vertex is placed in the cover.

Because the number of expanded vertexes is dependent on weight, the matching will tend to prefer the lower weight nodes. In the paper, this intuition is formalized and it is proven that the method will generate better than 2-approximate solutions for weighted vertex cover.},

Our new approximation algorithm does not need to solve a linear programming problem, nor such a formulation is needed to establish its approximation bound. The algorithm takes linear time with respect to the number of nodes and edges in the graph, and generates solutions that are within twice the weight of a minimum weight vertex cover. Both the algorithm and its proof of correctness are elegant and simple.},

	Abstract = {We present BSGP, a new programming language for general purpose computation on the GPU. A BSGP program looks much the same as a sequential C program. Programmers only need to supply a bare minimum of extra information to describe parallel processing on GPUs. As a result, BSGP programs are easy to read, write, and maintain. Moreover, the ease of programming does not come at the cost of performance. A well-designed BSGP compiler converts BSGP programs to kernels and combines them using optimally allocated temporary streams. In our benchmark, BSGP programs achieve similar or better performance than well-optimized CUDA programs, while the source code complexity and programming time are significantly reduced. To test BSGP's code efficiency and ease of programming, we implemented a variety of GPU applications, including a highly sophisticated X3D parser that would be extremely difficult to develop with existing GPU programming languages.},

	Abstract = { We give time lower bounds for the distributed approximation of minimum vertex cover (MVC) and related problems such as minimum dominating set (MDS). In k communication rounds, MVC and MDS can only be approximated by factors Ω(nc/k2/k) and Ω(Δ>1/k/k) for some constant c, where n and Δ denote the number of nodes and the largest degree in the graph. The number of rounds required in order to achieve a constant or even only a polylogarithmic approximation ratio is at least Ω(√log n/log log n) and Ω(logΔ/ log log Δ). By a simple reduction, the latter lower bounds also hold for the construction of maximal matchings and maximal independent sets. },
	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {The authors prove polylogarithmic lower bounds for any distributed solution to either the minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, or maximal matching problems. These bounds are non-constant whether the result is dependent on the number of nodes in the graph or the degree of the graph. Specifically, when analyzed by $n$, the running time and approximation result are polylogarithmic in $n$, and when analyzed by $\Delta$, the results are polylogarithmic in $\Delta$.

The proof depends on a specific graph structure that defeats any possible distributed algorithm for any of these problems by ensuring that, while the local view of the graph is identical to two given nodes, the result of adding one of these nodes is drastically different than the result of adding another. The proof is rigorous, and makes up the bulk of the paper.

 An open question is whether there are specific graph structures for which this is not true, and constant time approximations for these problems can be found.},

The proof of correctness and locality is quite rigorous and makes up the bulk of the paper. The algorithm as presented is linear but is trivially distributable. Essentially, each node elects a neighbor to join the DS, then if some node has more than a constant number of neighbors in the DS, it joins the DS and tells its neighbors to leave the set. These steps are repeated once, and then any uncovered nodes choose a neighbor to join the set.

Open questions are whether this algorithm could be improved upon in planar graphs or modified for another class of graphs. Some limitations on local approximation are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Energy consumption in monitoring and communication protocols for wireless sensor networks became one of the most important performance objective. We assume a commonly accepted sensor network model in which sensors can interchange idle and active modes both for monitoring and communicating. We introduce a reliability requirement for distributed target-monitoring protocols and prove that previously considered protocols (P. Berman et al., 2004) are reliable. In this paper we propose a new deterministic energy-efficient protocol for sensor networks (DEEPS) aimed at prolonging the lifetime. We prove that DEEPS is reliable and compare DEEPS with several known target-monitoring protocols in NS2 environment using LEACH (W. Heizelman et al., 2002) protocol for data delivery to the base. We implemented the full-fledged simulation of the monitoring protocols on NS2 combined with LEACH as a communication protocol, and performed extensive experimental study of several protocols showing almost 2 times increase in the lifetime for DEEPS over known protocols},
	Annote = {Brinza and Zelikovsky present a simple protocol (DEEPS) for extending network lifetime in a sensor network while maintaining target coverage. They show that the protocal is reliable, in that while it is possible to maintain coverage, the network will maintain coverage. They also compare their algorithm to previous work with simulation using NS2.

DEEPS essentially uses 1 set up rule and two behavior rules. The setup rule places a sensor in charge of each target. The first behavior rule is that a sensor that is the only sensor covering a target will always switch itself on, the second is that a sensor that is in charge of a target will remain on until some other sensor covers its target. In simulation DEEPS outperforms a prior protocol (LBP).},

	Abstract = {We present a new set of distributed algorithms for scheduling sensors to enhance the total lifetime of a wireless sensor network. These algorithms are based on constructing minimal cover sets each consisting of one or more sensors which can collectively cover the local targets.  Some of the covers are heuristically better than others for a sensor trying to decide its own sense-sleep status.  This leads to various ways to assign priorities to the covers. The algorithms work by having each sensor transition through these possible prioritized cover sets, settling for the best cover it can negotiate with its neighbors.   A local lifetime dependency graph consisting of the cover sets as nodes with any two nodes connected if the corresponding covers intersect captures the interdependencies among the covers. We present several variations of the basic algorithmic framework.  The priority function of a cover is derived from its degree or connectedness in the dependency graph - usually lower the better.  Lifetime improvement is 10% to 20% over the existing algorithms, while maintaining comparable communication overheads.   We also show how previous algorithms can be formulated within our framework. },
	Annote = {Prasad and Dhawan present a new distributed algorithm for the network lifetime problem in wireless sensor networks. This algorithm is based on local network nodes creating an exhaustive set of possible covers over their own targets, ordering those covers, and then turning off or on based on whether they are a member of the highest priority cover. The authors maintain that although the number of possible covers is exponential, this exponential number can be viewed as a constant for realistically sparse networks. 

A key concept in this paper is the idea of the Lifetime Dependency graph, a method of comparing covers in which each cover is a node in the graph, each shared sensors between nodes constitue an edge of the graph, and covers can be ordered by comparing the cumulative minimun lifetimes of the edges.

Simulation results show that this approach is an improvement on prior work. },

	Annote = {Dhawan and Prasad extend on earlier work, taking the explicit algorithm developed in \cite{978-3-540-77220-0_36} and expanding it to a general approach for locally solvable problems. The specific examples given--aside from target coverage--are variants of the target coverage problem described in earlier work, specifically area coverage and k-coverage.

The chief addition to earlier work is an explicit description of the requirements needed to utilize the framework for a generic problem.},
